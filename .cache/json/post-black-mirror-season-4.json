            "content": "Netflix has been tight-lipped about the release date for Season 4 of Black Mirror. However, the streaming giant continues to tease with trailers for each of the episodes. Thus far, we’ve got our hands on [trailers for Arkangel (directed by Jodie Foster) and Crocodile](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/netflix-keeps-the-mystery-alive-with-black-mirror/), both of which were creepy to our satisfaction.\n\nToday, Netflix has released a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV0J3Bq3BIc) for the third of six episodes.\n\nThis one is called _Black Museum_, starring Douglas Hodge and Letitia Wright, and directed by Colm McCarthy. It appears to tell the story of a guy named Rolo Haynes and his Black Museum, where he’s collected “authentic criminological artifacts.”\n\n“If it did something bad, chances are it’s in here,” says Haynes in the trailer. “There’s a sad sick, story behind most everything here.”\n\nRecognize anything familiar in this trailer? There are a few tidbits that recall earlier episodes of Black Mirror, suggesting that the whole series takes place in a shared universe. Fun.\n\nIt would seem that Netflix is releasing a trailer every other day as part of Netflix’s “13 days of Black Mirror” promo, and we’re halfway through the trailer release. Hopefully, we’ll get a season 4 release date at the end of this trailer tease.\n\nWe won’t know for sure until it happens, but one thing we know for certain: “This place ain’t for the faint-hearted.”\n"
