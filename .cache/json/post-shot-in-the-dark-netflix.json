It's basically the same premise, but in real life as NetflixÂ follows freelance journalists, also called stringers, who chase news stories all over Los Angeles throughout the night.\n\nArmed with cameras, police scanners and some high powered cars, the trio of competitors scour the city in search of crime, accidents, fires, basically anything that's newsworthy to film and sell to the news networks.\n\nAt times the show can make for uncomfortable viewing and viewer discretion is advised in many cases. As we watch the stringers carry out their jobs, the lines between what's ethical and oftentimes downright sinister get blurred as they wait for accidents to happen.\n\n\"I film people's misery, I'm there at the worst times in their lives,\" one of the stringers says in the show.\n\nThe series keeps you in the passenger seat as the stringers respond to all types of situations from occupational hazards like getting too close to an accident, acting as a first responder, to the morally questionable waiting intently for an accident you know is going to happen (you'll understand after the first episode).\n\nA series where the first question is always, \"Are you OK?\", but the second is, \"Did you get the tape?\"\n\nTheir positive interactions with police and firefighters show ensures that this type of activity will remain the norm for the foreseeable, and the gripping episodes will have hungry for more insight into this strange, numb, and chilling world.\n\nThe first series of the show is available on Netflix and well worth some of your time.\n\n### **While you're here... Why not watch the latest JOE Show with stars of Irish comedy Nowhere Fast Alison Spittle and Clare Monnelly!**\n"
