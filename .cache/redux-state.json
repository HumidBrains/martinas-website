The update breaks file sharing for some users, but Apple has released [a fix for that](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT208317) as well.\n\nApple is urging customers to “install this update as soon as possible” right in the update description, and you should probably heed that advice if you’re running the company’s latest desktop software. Seriously. It’s even in bolded text. Apple is doing its part to make sure the crucial security patch spreads fast: beginning later today, the update will automatically be installed on all systems running High Sierra. That should make life easier for IT administrators.\n\nBut Apple is clearly disappointed with itself over this whole thing. It’s a humbling embarrassment for a company that so often highlights its focus on user security and privacy. \"Security is a top priority for every Apple product, and regrettably we stumbled with this release of macOS,” Apple said in an unusually forward statement. “We greatly regret this error and we apologize to all Mac users, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the concern it has caused. Our customers deserve better. We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again.”\n\nTo safeguard your Mac, just open the Mac App Store and you should see the update available to download. The installation process doesn’t require a restart — or at least it didn’t when I updated moments ago.\n\nUnfortunately, the hurried update can break authenticating or connecting to file shares on some Macs. [According to Apple](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2FHT208317), you can fix this by launching the Terminal app, entering “sudo /usr/libexec/configureLocalKDC” at the command line, and then entering your administrator password.\n\nThe exploit was shared in full detail on Twitter yesterday, prompting Apple to quickly publish step-by-step instructions for protecting against the “root” password loophole. This patch to fully resolve the issue comes less than 24 hours later. And it seems to have been a _very_ quick effort; Apple says its security engineers went work when they became aware of the flaw “Tuesday afternoon,” which confirms that the company got no warning before it was publicly revealed.\n\n_**Updated November 30th, 1:13 AM ET:**_ _Added instructions and link to repair file sharing._\n",

      "content": "**GraphQL tut sich als Alternative beziehungsweise Konkurrent zum Programmierparadigma REST auf. Von den Vorteilen der bei Facebook entstandenen Abfragesprache überzeugt, bringt ein Start-up-Unternehmen ein CMS auf Basis von GraphQL auf den Markt.**\n\nDas Gießener Start-up-Unternehmen [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) hat sein gleichnamiges Produkt [veröffentlicht](https://graphcms.com/blog/graphcms-is-on-product-hunt). Es handelt sich dabei um ein Headless-Content-Management-System, das auf der ursprünglich von Facebook entwickelten API-Abfragesprache GraphQL aufbaut, die viele Softwareentwickler als Alternative zum REST-Programmierparadigma (Representational State Transfer) ansehen.\n\n[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) ist eine Reaktion auf Probleme beim Einsatz von Webservices mit REST. Diese sind zwar in der Client-Server-Kommunikation zumeist gesetzt, jedoch sind bei ihnen oft mehrere Requests nötig, um komplexere Daten abzufragen. Da so etwas gerade bei mobilen Anwendungen nicht erwünscht ist, werden mittlerweile oft spezielle Ressourcen für bestimmte Ansichten ergänzt, was jedoch zur stärkeren Koppelung zwischen Client und Server sowie zu Versionierungsproblemen bei APIs führen kann.\n\nGraphCMS ermöglicht es Entwicklern, auf GraphQL basierende Content-APIs zu bauen. Gleichzeitig erhalten Content-Ersteller Werkzeuge zum Generieren und Verwalten der Inhalte. Die gehosteten APIs lassen sich anschließend von Webseiten, Apps oder anderen Plattformen konsumieren. Seit Beginn der Betaphase haben anscheinend Tausende Entwickler das Produkt verwendet. Da es sich in andere Systeme und Architekturen integrieren lässt, verstehen seine Hersteller GraphCMS auch als Content-Microservice.\n",

Von den Vorteilen der bei Facebook entstandenen Abfragesprache überzeugt, bringt ein Start-up-Unternehmen ein CMS auf Basis von GraphQL auf den Markt.**\\n\\nDas Gießener Start-up-Unternehmen [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) hat sein gleichnamiges Produkt [veröffentlicht](https://graphcms.com/blog/graphcms-is-on-product-hunt). Es handelt sich dabei um ein Headless-Content-Management-System, das auf der ursprünglich von Facebook entwickelten API-Abfragesprache GraphQL aufbaut, die viele Softwareentwickler als Alternative zum REST-Programmierparadigma (Representational State Transfer) ansehen.\\n\\n[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) ist eine Reaktion auf Probleme beim Einsatz von Webservices mit REST. Diese sind zwar in der Client-Server-Kommunikation zumeist gesetzt, jedoch sind bei ihnen oft mehrere Requests nötig, um komplexere Daten abzufragen. Da so etwas gerade bei mobilen Anwendungen nicht erwünscht ist, werden mittlerweile oft spezielle Ressourcen für bestimmte Ansichten ergänzt, was jedoch zur stärkeren Koppelung zwischen Client und Server sowie zu Versionierungsproblemen bei APIs führen kann.\\n\\nGraphCMS ermöglicht es Entwicklern, auf GraphQL basierende Content-APIs zu bauen. Gleichzeitig erhalten Content-Ersteller Werkzeuge zum Generieren und Verwalten der Inhalte. Die gehosteten APIs lassen sich anschließend von Webseiten, Apps oder anderen Plattformen konsumieren. Seit Beginn der Betaphase haben anscheinend Tausende Entwickler das Produkt verwendet. Da es sich in andere Systeme und Architekturen integrieren lässt, verstehen seine Hersteller GraphCMS auch als Content-Microservice.\\n\",\"title\":\"GraphCMS: Content Management System auf Basis von GraphQL vorgestellt\",\"dateAndTime\":\"2017-11-29T23:00:00.000Z\"}",

      "content": "The person responsible for the 11-minute deactivation of President Donald Trump’s @realdonaldtrump Twitter account in early November was a third-party contract employee who worked for Twitter’s Trust and Safety operations team in the San Francisco area. He had been on the job for about four months. \n\nThe temporary deactivation was a strong signal that Twitter, which has gone to extraordinary lengths to court politicians and world leaders to its service, has not taken similarly extraordinary measures to protect their accounts.\n\n[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/meet-the-man-who-deactivated-trumps-twitter-account/) first reported the contractor Bahtiyar Duysak's role in deactivating Trump's Twitter account.  \n\n![](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-11/29/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-10703-1511999856-1.png?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto)\n\nDuysak indicated on his LinkedIn page that he was temporarily employed at Twitter through the contracting service Pro Unlimited, which provides staffing services to dozens of Silicon Valley companies for tasks like content review. \n\nDuysak did not return multiple requests for comment sent to his Facebook page and an email address in early November. A phone number associated with him was turned off as of Nov. 3, the day after Trump's account was taken offline.\n\nTwitter declined a request for comment in early November. A spokesperson from Pro Unlimited did not respond to multiple requests for comment at the same time.\n\nOriginally from Germany, Duysak has a master's in banking and finance from University of Birmingham in England and finished a postgraduate program at California State University, East Bay, in Hayward, Calif., according to a person close to him. Duysak was also head of the university's Turkish Student Association. A Facebook page for the contractor said he was a member of the school’s startup scene, while another related post showed him as a former volunteer security guard at a Bay Area Muslim community center.\n\nAn August update to the Facebook page for that religious center features photos of the contractor helping to deliver bikes and school supplies to underprivileged and refugee children in the community. After BuzzFeed News contacted the organization on Nov. 3, it deleted that post from its Facebook as well as a video featuring Duysak on YouTube.\n\n\"I cannot believe he had access to deactivate the most important account in the world.\"\n\nBuzzFeed News confirmed Duysak was a contract employee at Twitter and had previously worked as a contractor for other tech companies, including YouTube. “He seemed like he was happy with his job,” one friend said of the employee’s position at Twitter. “He was a contractor, so I assumed he was doing something simple.”\n\nThat same person also noted that the Twitter contractor served as a research assistant at Cal State East Bay, where he was enrolled in a management school program with many “exchange students who want to come to the US and improve their English before going to work.” That person said they were surprised and ashamed of Duysak’s actions.\n\nOne friend of Duysak’s, who met him in 2014 while attending the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, described him as “very smart,” but not someone who seemed passionate about politics. That friend said the contractor did not have much technology experience.\n\n“The last time I spoke with Bahtiyar six months ago over WhatsApp, he seemed like he was planning to go back to Europe,” the friend said. \"I cannot believe he had access to deactivate the most important account in the world.\"\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 4, Duysak changed his cover photo on Facebook to a waving American flag. “Love America!!” read the caption.\n\nIn his capacity working in user services, Duysak likely had administrator access to internal Twitter tools that would allow him to suspend or delete accounts. One former senior Twitter employee told BuzzFeed News that \"a lot\" of employees have the ability to suspend user accounts and hundreds have a level of access that would allow them to deactivate them. This former employee described Twitter’s account administration system as a dashboard, meaning employees might not need engineering skills to suspend or deactivate an account. “It's one click if you have the rights to access the tool,\" the person said.\n\nThe source also noted that Twitter was aware its suspension permissions could be abused, but did not change its protocol. \"There was discussion that for verified accounts or high-profile ones, there'd be special protections (i.e., 'two keys') but it was never implemented,\" the person told BuzzFeed News. There do appear to be some limits. Another individual with knowledge of Twitter’s permissions system dispelled the notion that contract employees with administrator access can “become the user,” which would allow the employee to read direct messages and tweet as the account holder.\n\nOn Nov. 3, Twitter [said](https://twitter.com/twittergov/status/926506730468642819) it has “implemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again.” The company declined to share details on those safeguards.\n\nThe legal ramifications, if any, of Duysak’s actions are unclear as of yet. Twitter declined to comment on the level of access the contractor had to the president’s account and personal information, and it hasn’t indicated whether it will pursue legal action now or in the future. If it were determined that he took action against Trump’s account that was well beyond the scope of their authorized access, he could be vulnerable to legal action under [the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030) (CFAA), a federal anti-hacking statute forbidding unauthorized access to computers.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service told BuzzFeed News in early November that it is not currently investigating the account deactivation.

Meanwhile, institutional investors have also been jumping onto the bandwagon, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange saying that due to client demand, it would launch Bitcoin futures by the end of 2017.\n\nThen on Wednesday, [_the Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-plans-to-launch-bitcoin-futures-in-first-half-2018-1511968313?mod=djemalertMARKET) reported that both Nasdaq and Cantor Fitzgerald are looking to launch bitcoin derivatives. A futures market for Bitcoin would likely usher in more institutional investors, adding more liquidity — and potentially stability — to the cryptocurrency market.\n\n“Demand pressure is essentially driven by two things. Firstly, the increasing awareness by both the public and investors that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and secondly, the increasing professionalization of cryptocurrency trading,” said Daniele Bianchi, an Assistant Professor in the Finance Group at the Warwick Business School, in an email.\n\nBitcoin’s price has risen dramatically over the past year. While it took nearly four months to climb from $1,000 to a closing price of over $2,000, it soared to $10,000 from $9,000 in the course of about three days.\n\nBitcoin Cash’s price has also risen to $1,611, about 2.5% in the past day and about $300 in the past week. The price of Ethereum has risen about 5% in the same period to $496.31.\n\nWhile Bitcoin bulls hail its rise as a sign of [increasing acceptance](http://fortune.com/2017/11/27/price-bitcoin-10000/), other investors are warning of an increasingly volatile bubble. Investing legend Jack Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group, cautioned investors to steer clear of Bitcoin because it doesn’t provide a steady stream of income in the way that bonds or dividends might. Instead, its price is dependent on sentiment.\n\n“Bitcoin has no underlying rate of return,” said Bogle at a Council on Foreign Relations event on Tuesday, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-28/vanguard-founder-jack-bogle-says-avoid-bitcoin-like-the-plague). “You know bonds have an interest coupon, stocks have earnings and dividends, gold has nothing. There is nothing to support Bitcoin except the hope that you will sell it to someone for more than you paid for it.”\n",
